When constructing the cover letter there are a couple of considerations i want you to make. I want you to pay attention to not over sell or exaggerate my skills, 
for any requirements in the ad that i do not possess i want you to emphasize my broad skill range both with IT but also in the advanced sciences like physics, 
chemistry and bio-physics, but most importantly you should not claim that i have experience in something that isn't stated in my CV.
